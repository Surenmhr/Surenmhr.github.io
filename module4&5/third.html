                    <h2>Faces of Nepal</h2>
                    <p>Nepal’s true treasure is its people. Known for their warmth, hospitality, and resilience, the Nepalese represent a beautiful mosaic of ethnicities and cultures. Communities like the Sherpas in the mountains, the Tharus in the Terai plains, and the Newars in the Kathmandu Valley each bring unique traditions, languages, and cuisines to the national identity. Visitors are often touched by the genuine kindness and welcoming nature of locals, who are always ready to share a cup of traditional chiya (tea) and stories of their homeland. Despite challenges, the spirit of the Nepalese people—characterized by hard work, optimism, and strong community ties—continues to inspire travelers from all walks of life.</p>
