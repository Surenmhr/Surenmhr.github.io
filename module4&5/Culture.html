        <h2>Culture of Nepal</h2>
        <p >Culture
            Nepal’s rich cultural tapestry reflects its deep history and diverse ethnic communities. Ancient cities like Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan are adorned with intricately carved temples, historic palaces, and sacred stupas, many of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Festivals such as Dashain, Tihar, and Holi bring the country to life with vibrant colors, music, and dance. The serene sound of monks chanting in centuries-old monasteries contrasts with the bustling energy of local markets, where traditional crafts and handmade goods showcase the skill of Nepalese artisans. From the towering stupas of Buddhism to the intricate rituals of Hinduism, Nepal’s spiritual heritage is deeply woven into everyday life.</p>
