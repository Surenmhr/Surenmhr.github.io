                <p>Hello!
                I'm a hospitality and tourism professional with a Bachelor's in Hospitality Management and a Master's in Tourism Marketing and Management. 
                My experience spans roles in Finland and Germany, from customer service to logistics.
                Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by studying Cyber Security at Laurea UAS, driven by a passion for technology.      
                I love traveling, which helps me unwind and gain new perspectives. In my free time, I enjoy exploring history, culture, and technology through informative videos. This curiosity fuels my passion for creating memorable travel experiences and broadening my worldview.</p>
